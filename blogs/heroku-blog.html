        <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2" id="blog-writing">
            <p> Deploying and hosting a website for the first time was pretty difficult. I haven’t had much experience in this
                area and I didn’t have enough back-end knowledge. I ran into a lot of trouble because I already created all
                of my code in basic HTML/CSS/Javascript. Furthermore, I also didn’t have a clear understanding of the Model-View-Controller
                (MVC) framework. Hosting was a lot more difficult than I thought had thought.</p>
            <p> I also decided to use Heroku because it was free. However, Heroku usually doesn’t host static sites so I had
                to figure how to host my static site. A friend helped me out and sent me a link to trick Heroku to allow
                me to host this by using some php code. <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/deploy-static-site-heroku"
                    target="_blank">Lifesaver!</a> </p>
            <p> However, more issues came up when I had to figure out ‘url re-writing’. I wasn’t exactly sure how to do this
                because of no prior php knowledge. I found a separate useful source that allowed me to get rid of all my
                ugly url (it displayed the path so it’d look like www.blahblah.com/views/blah.html.) Following this guide
                helped me get rid off all the path urls that I didn't want other people to see. I also thought of it as somewhat
                unprofessional and messy.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Essentially, this a buildpack to help handle static sites. It creates a static.json file that allowed us to set values to
                either clean the URLs, (you can drop the .html), custom routes, and set a root directory folder. All of this allowed me to host my website
                on heroku and fix some of the issues I had with the previous guide. Because I had multiple pages I had traverse through all of my different
                html page files. The previous guide would've fine with a SPA (single page application) but not for my case.
            </p>
            <p> Through this project of hosting, I learned from my mistakes and naivety. Hosting is a much more difficult process than I thought.
                This makes me want to pursue backend development more because of its power and what you can do. I really want to become a fullstack developer after this
                project. My website still has html displayed at the end for some odd reason that I will figure out later on, but for now my issue is 99% solved.
