            <p> This is basically serving as an introduction to myself and 
                my attempts of blogging. I don't really blog so I'm not sure what I should be saying in these posts.
                Furthermore, I felt like writing throughout my learning could prove to be beneficial in many ways (and also relaxing). Anyways,
                I'm going to talk about myself for a bit now and how and why I decide to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was an Electrical Engineering (technically still am) that attends University of California, Santa Barbara. I stuck with my major despite my lack of success and interest.
                Until recently, I stuck with it. Not sure completely why I did but I did. A couple of month ago, I started looking into other paths. I knew I liked engineering so I looked around 
                computer science and tried to find my interests. I browsed multiple forums and reddit looking for help to answer my question,<strong>"What the hell do I want to do?"</strong>
                I looked through different languages such as Python, C, C++, and etc... I looked up differnet aspects of CS such as creating games or web scraping. Eventually, I found web development and 
                tried it out for a bit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the first thing in a while that sparked my interest. I never actually been so interested and wanted to learn as much as I did with this field. However, this field was <i> a pain in the ass </i> to get in started in.
                Everywhere I looked for help had clashing opinions. Here are a couple of things I saw when I was trying to figure out what to learn.
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn React. Angular is dying and React is gaining popularity!</li>
                    <li> Vue.js! The next big thing! Easier to use and will probably replace some of the frameworks now!</li>
                    <li> Learn Jquery vs Jquery is dying! stay away!</li>
                    <li> Learn Bootstrap, it helps so much with the grid systems vs do you really want another 'classic bootstrap' website?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
               <p>Oh boy I wasted so many hours doing researching when everything came down to biased opinions. Eventually, I just said ok learn this and this whether or not how useful it is. I went on to learn Bootstrap, Jquery, and SCSS. These skills
                   may be useless or replaced by a better framework or library in the future but learning it was still fun and interesting. I liked learning about what about these libraries/frameworks made them unique or "better" than
                   plain old CSS and Javascript. The most interesting part of learning web development is how fast it changes. One second this is the hype and the next something else is the hype. So many different things that do the same thing with one small difference.
                   Either way, these frameworks <strong> definitely</strong> helped my development. There are so many shortcuts and things that made my code and life easier. However, I agree that it is important to understand the bare bones. 
                   I don't think you should rely on solely the library/framework. 
               </p>
               <p> 
                 I could ramble for more but I'll keep this short. I'm extremely glad I found something I love doing. Yeah there are annoying things (changing letter-spacing from 0.8px to 0.7px) that stresses me out.
                 However, I'm always excited to learn more and create things.
               </p>
               <p> I will end with a cheesy quote about how I feel about web development and my learning process. I'll also create a list of all the resources that have helped me.
