            <p> Gulp is a very powerful tool that will make life a lot easier for developers. I just recently started looking
                into gulp and it has already helped me save time. Simple tasks such as refreshing a browser shouldn't be
                complained about but having a tool do that for you just makes things easier and more efficient. One thing
                that it has helped me tremendously on is sass preprocessing. I used to use a sass preprocessor tool called
                <i>Prepos</i> but it kept bugging me every like 5 minutes to buy the full version. I eventually got fed up
                with this and decided to see what the big I'll help you guys get started on using gulp and to simply automate
                what I have automated (which isn't too much yet to be honest) deal was about gulp. After using the very basic
                commands and understanding what gulp was about I finally understand the power of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, make sure you have node.js instead. If not, head over to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>                download it and become familiar with its commands. Head over to your project root folder in your command
                line and use these commands.
            </p>

            <p class="code-example">
                npm init<br> npm install gulp -g <br> npm install gulp --save-dev
            </p>
            <p> Next, you'll want to create a gulpfile.js within the root of your folder. Here's how a basic gulpfile.js will
                look like.</p>
            <p class="code-example">
                var gulp = require('gulp');<br><br> gulp.task('default', function() { <br> &ensp;// place code for your default
                task here <br> });
            </p>
            <p> After setting up the gulp file we'll want to automate some simple tasks. Personally, I use SASS and preprocess
                it with gulp so for the sake of this blog I'll use that as an example. Here's how you would set up sass for
                gulp.
            </p>
            <p class="code-example"> npm install gulp-sass --save-dev</p>
            <p> Within the gulpfile you'll also want to require sass too like you did with require('gulp'). You'll also want
                to create a task for sass by doing the following.
            </p>
            <p class="code-example">
                var sass = require('sass');<br><br> gulp.task('sass', function() { <br> return gulp.src('source-file')<br>                &ensp;&ensp;.pipe(sass()) <br> &ensp;&ensp;.pipe(gulp.dest('destination-file') <br> });
            </p>
            <p> The code is very simple. The src method is where the scss file are located. The destination file is the folder
                where the output css file will be created. My source file is my scss/example.scss. My destination file would
                then be my css folder or 'styles'. If you only have one file to prepocess then you can just use target that
                one file. However, there will most likely be multiple files so you'll want to select all of the scss files.
                You can do so by doing this.
            </p>
            <p class="code-example"> gulp.src('scss/**/*.scss').</p>
            <p> To explain more in-depth, globs in node are used to match patterns for files. We'll mainly use 4 different patterns.
                <ol>
                    <li> <span style="font-size: 25px; background-color: gainsboro">*</span>: This pattern is used to match any pattern in the
                    current directory. In this case, we'll use *.scss to match any files that contain the ".scss" tag.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-size: 25px; background-color: gainsboro">**/*</span>: This pattern is used to match any pattern in the
                    root folders and all of its children folders. This is similar to the pattern 1.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-size: 25px; background-color: gainsboro">*.+(example1|example2)</span>: This pattern allows you to match multiple
                    patterns, which is separated by the | character. This uses the + and () characters. This will match any file ending with example1 or example2 in the root folder.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-size: 25px; background-color: gainsboro">!</span>: This pattern is used to match any pattern in the
                    current directory. In this case, we'll use *.scss to match any files that contain the ".scss" tag.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p> This works fine now. However, you don't want to keep running gulp sass to use sass. This is where the automation comes in. Next, you'll make a 
                watch function that will watch for changes in your files.
            </p>
            <p class="code-example">
                gulp.task('watch', function(){<br>
                gulp.watch('scss/*.scss', ['sass']); <br>
                })
            </p>
            <p> The code above is simple. Gulp will watch for changes in the source folder containing the pattern '.scss'. The ['sass] part after is to tell gulp
                what tasks to watch run. It can be thought of like this gulp.watch('files-to-watch-for', ['tasks-to-run']);. In this case, it looked for all the changes on my .scss files
                within my scss folder. It also ran the sass function/task on those changes. 
            </p>
            <p> That's all! This is very basic and I only covered a basic task and how to watch for changes. There are many others to learn about and will be very useful to learn!</p>
            <p> Heres how my code looks like at the end. It's preprocessing sass while automatically reloading the browser when I update my css or html files.</p>            
            <p class="code-example"> 
                var gulp = require('gulp');<br>
                 var sass = require('gulp-sass');<br> 
                 var browserSync = require('browser-sync').create(); <br><br>
                gulp.task('sass', function() { <br>
                    return gulp.src('scss/**/*.scss') <br>
                    &ensp;&ensp;.pipe(sass())<br>
                    &ensp;&ensp;.pipe(gulp.dest('styles'))
                .pipe(browserSync.reload({ stream: true }));<br>
                 });<br>
                  gulp.task('watch',['browserSync', 'sass'],
                function(){ <br>
                &ensp;&ensp;gulp.watch('scss/**/*.scss', ['sass']);<br>
                 &ensp;&ensp;gulp.watch('*.html').on('change',browserSync.reload);<br>
                 &ensp;&ensp;gulp.watch('blogs/*.html').on('change',browserSync.reload);<br>
                  });<br>
                gulp.task('browserSync', function(){<br>
                 &ensp;&ensp;browserSync.init({ <br>
                 server:{ baseDir: "./" } <br>
                 }); <br>
                 });
            </p>
